BETH Hackathon energy suisse challenge

How could Blockchain technology benefit the climate twice with a solution that documents in a ledger:
1) CO 2 emission reduction by households (e.g. in the fields of electricity, heat and mobility)
2) The reinvestment of saved costs in (local) sustainable projects with direct payments from the
consumer who saved energy to sustainable projects without costly/untrustworthy middlemen.


## Components
This project consists of three main components:

1. Blockchain: A Blockchain network for CO2 emission tracking
2. IoT: Internet of Things sensor to measure oil level
3. webapp: Web application with interface to blockchain network
